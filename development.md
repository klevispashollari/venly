This is a simple word association service. 
You can create association or retrieve existing associations,
created again by you because we are running this on an in memory database :).
To build the app simply run `mvn clean install`. 
To run the app you can run  `mvn spring-boot:run` if you want to look like a 
nice hacker or go to `VenlyApplication` class under  `com.example.venly` package
and run the main method from there. Enjoy your time.
